  <b>Spelldawn</b> is a digital card game based on Richard Garfield's 1996
  cyberpunk masterpiece <i>Netrunner</i> and its 2012 Fantasy Flight Games
  remake <i>Android: Netrunner</i>. If Netrunner is like Magic: The Gathering,
  then Spelldawn is like Hearthstone: a version of the game thatâ€™s simplified
  for fast play on mobile devices, but which preserves the core gameplay
  elements.

<p>
  Spelldawn is a trading card game. As you play, you will collect cards which
  you can trade with other players, putting an emphasis on your ability to build
  decks with the cards you <i>have</i> instead of following an existing
  metagame. Periodic "seasons" will challenge you to start this process over
  with an empty collection.

<p>
  The game is open source under the Apache License version 2.0, although the
  client uses proprietary art assets under the terms of the Unity Asset Store
  License. Spelldawn is and always will be free to play and will never sell
  cards in-game.
