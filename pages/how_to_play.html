<p>
  Spelldawn is not currently a game you can download and play. At time of
  writing, development is perhaps at most 20% complete, so everything here is
  extremely subject to change based on iteration and playtesting. The game
  doesn't currently have an in-game tutorial of any kind, so this serves as an
  introduction until we can make one.

</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Spelldawn is a card game for two players set in a high fantasy
  universe. One player acts as the <b>Overlord</b>, a dungeon master attempting
  to put their nefarious schemes into effect. The other player assumes the role
  of the <b>Champion</b>, a valiant hero attempting to delve into the dungeon
  and thwart the forces of evil.
</p>

<p>
  Players in Spelldawn alternate taking turns, always beginning with the
  Overlord. During a player's turn, they have three
  <b>action points (<i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>)</b> to spend on a variety
  of possible game effects such as gaining
  <b>mana (<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>)</b>, drawing cards, and playing cards.
  The Overlord can play and level up their scheme cards in the rooms of the
  dungeon in order to score points, while deploying minions to defend them. The
  Champion can initiate a <b>raid</b> on a room of the dungeon to attempt to
  bypass the dungeon's defenses and score points by foiling the Overlord's
  plans.
</p>

<p>
  The objective of the game for both players is to score seven points. The
  Overlord scores points by leveling up their scheme cards, while the Champion
  scores points by initiating raids and stopping those schemes. The Champion
  also loses the game if they take too much damage (see
  <a href="#damage">Damage</a> below), and both players lose the game if they
  must draw a card from an empty deck.
</p>

<h1>Game Overview</h1>

<p>
  To start a game of Spelldawn, each player reveals their
  <b>identity card</b> to their opponent, a special card in play which can grant
  unique abilities throughout a game. Each player starts the game with 5 mana
  and draws 5 cards from their deck to form a starting hand. After drawing
  starting hands, the Overlord may choose to <b>mulligan</b> their hand,
  shuffling it back into their deck and drawing 5 new cards. After the Overlord
  has decided, the Champion decides whether to mulligan as well. The game then
  proceeds to the Overlord's first turn.
</p>

<p>
  The play area in Spelldawn is broken up into eight distinct areas
  called <b>Rooms</b>. These represent the different places within the
  Overlord's dungeon in which they enact their plans.
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/sampleGame.png" />

<p>Three of the rooms are for a special purpose, called <b>inner rooms</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <b>Sanctum</b> is a room which gives access to a card in the Overlord's
    hand
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Vault</b> is a room which controls access to the top card of
    Overlord's deck
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Crypts</b> give access to cards which the Overlord has discarded over
    the course of a game.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other rooms are referred to as <b>outer rooms</b>.</p>

<p>
  The user interface provides access to various features to enable game actions
  to be taken and for the state of different game zones to be inspected. Some of
  the different options are shown here:

<p>
  Don't worry if these concepts don't all make sense yet, refer back to this
  image after reading on below.
</p>

<h1>Schools of Magic</h1>
<p>
  In the world of Spelldawn, certain rare individuals can call upon
  powerful magical forces in order to accomplish their goals. Each person is
  primarily attuned to one of the three great <b>schools</b> of magic, allowing
  them to channel it into their spells for good or evil. Each card has a school
  associated with it and these are important for deckbuilding (see
  <a href="#deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</a> below).
</p>

<p>The schools of magic are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Law:</b> The magic of organization and order.</li>
  <li><b>Primal:</b> The magic of instinct and nature.</li>
  <li><b>Shadow:</b> The magic of deception and darkness.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition to the three schools, some cards have no school affiliation. These
  are called <b>neutral</b> cards and can be used in any deck.
</p>

<h1>Overlord Cards</h1>

<p>
  There are five types of Overlord cards: identities, spells, schemes, minions,
  and projects. All cards except the identity card are shuffled into the
  Overlord deck at the start of the game. Overlord permanent cards are played
  face down into different rooms.
</p>

<h2>Overlord Identity</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      The identity card defines who the Overlord is in the universe of
      Spelldawn. It influences the
      <a href="#deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</a> rules for the Overlord player,
      controlling the school to which cards in the deck must belong and how many
      cards are allowed from competing schools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Identity cards start the game in play, and provide abilities which are
      active throughout the game.
    </p>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    Spell cards represent one-time effects. They're always revealed when played
    and then discarded. The Overlord must pay the listed mana cost of the spell,
    and then the abilities are resolved in order. Once complete, the card is
    moved to the Crypts.

<h2>Schemes</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Scheme cards represent the Overlord's evil machinations to bring about
      their master plan. They are the only cards in Spelldawn that are
      worth scheme points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Overlord plays scheme cards face-down in outer rooms. Each scheme has
      a level requirement that must be met before the Overlord can score that
      card (see the <a href="#level-up-a-room">Level Up a Room</a> action).
      There can only ever be one scheme <b>or</b> one project in a room at a
      given time. Schemes have a <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Score</b> ability
      which resolves when the Overlord meets the level requirement.

      Minions are cards that the Overlord plays in order to defend the rooms of
      the dungeon against the Champion. Minions are played face down in rooms
      <i>without</i> paying their mana cost. They are automatically
      <b>summoned</b> and turned face up during a raid by paying their mana
      cost, if the Overlord has sufficient mana available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each minion has a <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Combat</b> ability which
      fires if the Champion is unable to defeat this minion in combat during a
      raid, as well as a <b>health</b> and optionally a <b>shield</b> value. See
      the <a href="#encounter-phase">Encounter Phase</a> section below for more
      information.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Projects provide the Overlord with resources in order to further their
      objectives. They're played in outer rooms in the same manner as schemes
      <i>without</i> paying their mana cost. Projects can specify an
      <b>Unveil</b> condition which causes them to be turned face up
      <i>if</i> the Overlord has sufficient mana available to pay their cost.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some projects with the <b>Level Up</b> keyword can be leveled up in the
      same manner as schemes, in order to mislead the Champion. When the
      Champion accesses a project they can <b>destroy</b> it by paying mana
      equal to its mana cost.

<h1>Champion Cards</h1>

<p>
  There are four types of Champion cards: identities, weapons, artifacts, and
  spells. As with the Overlord, the non-identity cards are shuffled together to
  create the Champion's deck. Champion cards are always played face-up.
</p>

<h2>Champion Identity</h2>

    <p><b>{#}Dawn:</b> If you have no cards in hand, draw a card.</p>
  </spelldawn-card>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      As with the Overlord, the Champion's identity card defines the character
      the Champion is playing as in the current game. The same
      <a href="#deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</a> restrictions apply to the
      Champion deck. The Champion identity card starts the game in play and
      provides ongoing abilities throughout the game.

<h2>Weapons</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Weapons are used by the Champion to defeat the Overlord's minons. The
      Champion plays weapons by paying their mana cost. During a raid, a weapon
      can be used to attack and defeat a minion if it is of the correct
      <a href="#lineage-types">Lineage</a> and its <b>attack value</b> equals or
      exceeds the minion's health.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each weapon starts with a base attack value which is shown on the card.
      Many weapons also have abilities which can increase their attack value
      during combat by paying mana.

    Artifacts provide a variety of additional tools for the Champion to draw
    upon. The Champion plays artifacts by paying their mana cost, and like
    weapons they enter play face-up and stay in play permanently (or until
    destroyed).
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Champion Spells</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    As with the Overlord, the Champion can wield Spell cards to apply one-time
    effects, paying their listed mana cost, resolving the effects in order, and
    then placing them into the discard pile.

  </spelldawn-card>
</div>

<h1>Turn Sequence</h1>

<p>
  Players in Spelldawn alternate taking turns, starting with the Overlord
  player. Players are never required to take an action during their opponenet's
  turn. Each player begins their turn with <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
  <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> (3 action
  points). A turn consists of these phases:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Start of Turn</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Draw</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Main</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Discard</b> Phase</li>
</ol>

<h2>Start of Turn Phase</h2>
<p>
  During the Start of Turn phase, triggered start-of-turn abilities on cards in
  play fire. The start of the Champion's turn is called <b>Dawn</b> and any
  cards with <i class="fas fa-bolt"></i><b>Dawn</b> trigger their abilities in
  this phase. The start of the Overlord's turn is called <b>Dusk</b> and fires
  <i class="fas fa-bolt"></i><b>Dusk</b> abilities.
</p>

<h2>Draw Phase</h2>

<p>
  The active player draws one card from their deck. If their deck is empty, that
  player immediately loses the game.
</p>

<h2>Main Phase</h2>

<p>
  The player takes actions by spending <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
  <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>. All action
  points must be spent during the main phase, after which the discard phase
  immediately begins.
</p>

<p>
  The active player can take the following actions as many times as they like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Gain 1<i
      class="fas fa-fire"
    ></i>
    (one mana)
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Draw a card
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Play a card from hand
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>, 1<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Level up a room (Overlord)
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Initiate a raid (Champion)
  </li>
  <li>
    Activate an <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> ability of a card in play
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gain Mana</h3>
<p>
  The player spends <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> to increase their mana pool
  by 1<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
</p>

<h3>Draw a Card</h3>
<p>
  For <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>, the player draws one card from their
  deck. This action cannot be taken if the deck is currently empty.
</p>

<h3>Play a Card</h3>
<p>
  The player pays <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> along with any required costs
  for a card in hand in order to play it.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Spell</b> cards require their mana cost to be paid immediately and
    resolve their effects immediately. They are then moved to the discard pile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Artifact</b> and <b>Weapon</b> cards require their mana cost to be paid
    immediately and are put into play face up on the Champion's side of the game
    arena.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Scheme</b> cards are played face down in an empty outer room that doesn't
    currently contain a scheme or project. They do not have mana costs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Project</b> cards do <i>not</i> require their mana cost to be paid
    immediately. They are played face down in an outer room that doesn't
    currently contain a scheme or project.
  <li>
    <b>Minion</b> cards do <i>not</i> require their mana cost to be paid
    immediately. They are put into play face down as the outermost defender in a
    room. A maximum of 4 minions can be in a room at any time. If an additional
    minion is played, the innermost minion is immediately moved to the Crypts.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Level Up a Room</h3>
<p>
  By paying <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> and 1<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>,
  the Overlord can pick an outer room to <b>level up</b>. They place one level
  counter on each card present in that room which can be leveled up. Cards other
  than schemes can only be leveled up if they have the <b>Level Up</b> keyword.
  The level up action cannot be taken on a room that has no cards that can be
  leveled up.
</p>

<p>
  When the number of level counters on a scheme card is greater than or equal to
  its level requirement, that card will immediately be <b>scored</b>. The scheme
  card is turned face up, and then any <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Score</b>
  abilities trigger. The Overlord gains scheme points equal to the points value
  of the card and it moves to their score area.
</p>

<h3>Initiate a Raid</h3>
<p>
  For <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>, the Champion can initiate a raid against
  one of the Overlord's non-empty rooms in order to score schemes and destroy
  projects. See <a href="#raids">Raids</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Activate an Abilitiy</h3>
<p>
  Some cards have <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> abilities listed on them.
  These are called <b>activated abilities</b> and can only be used during the
  owning player's Main phase by paying all of the listed costs.
</p>

<h2>Discard Phase</h2>
<p>
  Finally, the active player automatically discards down to their maximum hand
  size. Players begin the game with a maximum hand size of 7 cards, but card
  effects can increase or decrease this limit. If more cards are present in hand
  than their maximum hand size, players must discard their leftmost card until they
  are no longer above the maximum.
</p>

<h1>Lineage Types</h1>
<p>
  The world of Spelldawn is undergoing a confluence between three planes
  of existence. The original terrestrial plane is being overlaid by two other
  planes, the infernal plane and the abyssal plane, and creatures and items from
  those other worlds are now passing through into the mortal plane.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, there are three main types of weapons and minions in Spelldawn,
  called the <b>lineage</b> of that card. They are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="mortal lineage">Mortal</span>: Weapons and creatures from the
      original prime material plane.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="infernal lineage">Infernal</span>: Weapons and creatures from
      Infernum, a kingdom of flame and soot which exists in a perpetual state of war.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="abyssal lineage">Abyssal</span>: Weapons and creatures from The
      Abyss, the realm of darkness ruled over by the tyrannical ancient Demonlords.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Because of the nature of planar magical resonance, minions can only be damaged
  by a weapon from a matching lineage -- anyone attempt to wield a mortal weapon
  against a creature of Infernum will soon discover that their blade simply passes
  through the enemy like slicing through air!
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the main lineage types, some weapons and minions have special
  properties.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="prismatic lineage">Prismatic</span> weapons are rare and
      powerful magical artifacts which have the ability to damage enemies from
      any lineage.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="construct lineage">Construct</span> minions are mechanical
      assemblages which have disadvantage of being able to be damaged by any
      weapon type.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h1>Raids</h1>
<p>
  During a raid, the Champion attacks one of the Overlord's rooms in order to
  foil their schemes and destroy ongoing projects. They encounter each minion
  defending the room in sequence, either defeating that minion using their
  weapons or suffering its combat effects.
</p>
<p>
  Raids are broken up into three phases:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Start of Raid</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Encounter</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Access</b> Phase</li>
</ol>

<h2>Starting a Raid</h2>
<p>
  When a raid is declared on a room, any <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Raid</b>
  abilities on cards in play trigger. Next, the game checks if the room is
  defended by any minions which are face-up or which the Overlord has sufficient
  mana available to summon. If any such minion exists, the raid proceeds to the
  Encounter phase, otherwise it moves to the Access phase.
</p>

<h2>Encounter Phase</h2>

<h3>Approaching Minions</h3>

<p>
  During the encounter phase, the Champion <b>approaches</b> each minion in the
  target room in sequence, starting with the outermost minion. If the defending
  minion is face-down and the Overlord currently has mana available to pay its
  listed summon cost, the minion is <b>summoned</b>, turning it face up. Any
  <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Summon</b> abilities on the card trigger.
</p>

<p>
  If the approached minion is face-up, the Champion <b>encounters</b> that
  minion. Otherwise, the Champion approaches the next minion in sequence, or
  proceeds to the Access phase if no minions remain.
</p>

<h3>Encountering a Minion</h3>

<p>
  When a minion is encountered, the Champion must either <b>defeat</b> the
  minion or continue and have its <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Combat</b>
  ability fire.
</p>

<p>
  In order to defeat a minion, the Champion must do two things:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pay an amount of mana equal to the shield value of the minion, if
      any. Some card effects such as the <b>Breach</b> keyword reduce the amount
      that must be paid for shield values.
    </li>
    <li>
      Deal damage to the minion equal to its health value. Weapons with
      the same lineage type as the minion deal damage equal to their base attack
      value plus any bonuses from abilities.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Defeat is always temporary for the Overlord's minions, as they are soulbound
  to their post by the summoning ritual and resurrect after a few hours. The minion
  is not removed from the room when defeated, but stays in play -- ready for the
  next raid.
</p>

<p>
  Once the minion is either defeated or has used its combat abilities, the
  next minion in sequence is approached, or the raid moves to the Access phase.
</p>

<h3>Attack Boosts</h3>

<p>
  Many weapons have printed abilities which temporarily increase their attack
  value, called an <b>attack boost</b>, in the form of a cost to add some amount
  of attack. Unless otherwise indicated, this cost can be paid any number of
  times to reach the target, and the increased attack value lasts only for the
  duration of the current minion encounter.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if the Champion has a weapon with a base attack of 3 and a boost
  ability "2<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>: +1 Attack", the champion can pay
  2<i class="fas fa-fire"></i> per attack point required. If they are attempting
  to defeat a minion with 5 health, they can do so by paying 4<i class="fas
  fa-fire"></i> to activate the attack boost twice. The weapon's attack value
  then reverts to 3.
</p>

<h2>Access Phase</h2>

<h3>Raid Success</h3>
<p>
  Once all of the minions defending the target room have been passed, the raid
  is considered a success, and any <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Successful
  Raid</b> triggers on cards in play fire. The Champion then <b>accesses</b> cards as
  follows based on the target room:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Sanctum</b>: The Champion accesses one random card from the Overlord's
    hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Vault</b>: The Champion accesses the top card of the Overlord's deck. The
    accessed card is not revealed to the Overlord.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Crypts</b>: The Champion accesses all face-down cards in the Overlord's
    discard pile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Outer Room</b>: The Champion accesses the project or server card
    occupying the room.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Cards</h3>
<p>
  When the Champion accesses cards, the actions they can take vary based on the
  type of the accessed card:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the Champion acceses a scheme card they may score it, gaining
    scheme points equal to its points value and then moving it to their score
    area. This does <i>not</i> trigger the <b><i class="fas
    fa-bolt"></i>Score</b> ability of the card.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Champion accesses a project card, it becomes revealed. The Champion
    may destroy it by paying its unveil cost and then moving it to the Overlord's
    discard pile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other card types have no effect when accessed other than becoming revealed
    to the Champion. The revealed state of cards persists across game zones,
    for example they continue to be revealed when a minion is played from hand
    into a specific room.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When accessing multiple cards, the Champion may take these actions in any
  order. After concluding access actions, the raid ends and the Champion's main
  phase resumes.
</p>

<h1>Other Card Abilities</h1>

<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>
  Some cards and abilities deal <b>damage</b> to the Champion. When the Champion takes
  damage, they must discard one card from their hand at random per point of
  damage dealt. If the Champion takes more damage than the number of cards in
  their hand, they immediately lose the game.
</p>

<h2>Curses</h2>
<p>
  A card ability may apply a <b>curse</b> to the Champion. Curses are spell cards
  with the text "Cannot be discarded" which are generated in the Champion's
  hand. They may also have other ongoing effects while in hand. Curses have a
  mana cost of 2<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>. While the Champion has a curse card
  in hand they are said to be <b>cursed</b>.
</p>
<p>
  A curse card can never be discarded to damage or to hand size during the
  discard phase. However, curses can be removed from hand by playing them normally via
  the 'Play Card' action, spending <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> and
  2<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>. If the Champion's hand consists <i>only</i>
  of curse cards when they take damage, they lose the game due to being unable
  to discard a card.
</p>

<h1>Winning the Game</h1>
<p>There are three primary ways in which a game of Spelldawn can end:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If at any time a player has 7 or more points, they immediately win the game
  </li>
  <li>
    If a player attempts to draws a card from an empty deck, their opponenent
    wins the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Champion takes damage and is unable to discard a card, the Overlord
    wins the game.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Deckbuilding</h1>
<p>
  A deck in Spelldawn consists of 50 regular cards and an identity card.
  Decks are associated with a specific side (Overlord or Champion) and a
  primary <a href="#schools-of-magic">school</a> of magic. Decks cannot contain
  more than 3 copies of any card by name.

<p>
  The chosen identity card must match the school for the deck. Decks can contain any
  number of neutral cards and cards from that school. In addition, the identity
  card gives a number of <b>competing school</b> cards allowed in the deck. For
  example, a Shadow deck whose identity displays the number 6 may contain any
  number of Shadow and neutral cards, but can contain at most 6 Law or Primal cards.
</p>

<p>
  The Overlord deck must contain at least 20 scheme points worth of scheme cards.
</p>

<h1>Rarity and Game Rewards</h1>
<p>
  The winner of a game of Spelldawn receives a pack of 5 cards as a
  reward. Cards are available in four levels of rarity: Common, Rare, Exalted,
  and Legendary.
</p>

<p>
  The first four cards in a pack occupy <b>normal slots</b> and can contain any
  rarity of cards, in this distribution:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Common</b>: 80%</li>
  <li><b>Rare</b>: 15%</li>
  <li><b>Exalted</b>: 4%</li>
  <li><b>Legendary</b>: 1%</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The fifth card in a pack occupies the <b>rare slot</b> and always contains a
  rare card or better, following this distribution:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Rare</b>: 75%</li>
  <li><b>Exalted</b>: 20%</li>
  <li><b>Legendary</b>: 5%</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Card packs are conceptually generated by drawing without replacement from a
  player's <b>reward deck</b>, a collection which initially contains 3 copies of
  every card in the game. This means that packs are more likely to contain cards
  that have not previously been collected, and can never contain cards that a
  player already has 3 copies of. If the reward deck is empty for a given rarity
  level, pack generation reverts to random selection.
</p>

<h2>Experience Points</h2>
<p>
  The loser of a game of Spelldawn does not receive any cards, but they
  do gain the benefit of experience, learning from their defeat in order to
  improve in the future. This player earns 60 <b>experience points</b> after
  losing a game. 100 experience points can be redeemed for a card pack.
