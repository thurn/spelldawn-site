<p>
  Spelldawn is not currently a game you can download and play. At time of
  writing, development is perhaps at most 20% complete, so everything here is
  extremely subject to change based on iteration and playtesting. The game
  doesn't currently have an in-game tutorial of any kind, so this serves as the
  only introduction to playing the game.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Spelldawn is a card game for two players set in a high fantasy universe. One
  player acts as the <b>Overlord</b>, a dungeon master attempting to put their
  nefarious schemes into effect. The other player assumes the role of the
  <b>Champion</b>, a valiant hero attempting to delve into the dungeon and
  thwart the forces of evil.
</p>

<p>
  Players in Spelldawn alternate taking turns, always beginning with the
  Overlord. During a player's turn, they have
  <b>action points (<i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>)</b> to spend on a variety
  of possible game effects such as gaining
  <b>mana (<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>)</b>, drawing cards, and playing cards.
  The Overlord can play and progress their <b>scheme</b> cards in the rooms of
  the dungeon in order to score points, while deploying minions to defend them.
  The Champion can initiate a <b>raid</b> on a room of the dungeon to attempt to
  bypass the dungeon's defenses and score points by foiling the Overlord's
  plans.
</p>

<p>
  The objective of the game for both players is to score 60 points. The
  Overlord scores points by progresing their scheme cards, while the Champion
  scores points by initiating raids and scoring those schemes. The Champion
  also loses the game if they take too much damage (see
  <a href="#damage">Damage</a> below), and the Overlord loses the game if they
  must draw a card from an empty deck.
</p>

<h1>Game Overview</h1>

<p>
  To start a game of Spelldawn, each player reveals their
  <b>riftcaller card</b> and any <b>boon cards</b> to their opponent,
  special cards in play which can grant
  unique abilities throughout a game. Each player starts the game with 5 mana
  and draws 5 cards from their deck to form a starting hand. After drawing
  starting hands, the Overlord may choose to <b>mulligan</b> their hand,
  shuffling it back into their deck and drawing 5 new cards. After the Overlord
  has decided, the Champion decides whether to mulligan as well. The game then
  proceeds to the Overlord's first turn.
</p>

<p>
  The play area in Spelldawn is broken up into eight distinct areas called
  <b>Rooms</b>. These represent the different places within the Overlord's
  dungeon in which they enact their plans.
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/sampleGame.png" />

<p>Three of the rooms are for a special purpose, called <b>inner rooms</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <b>Sanctum</b> is a room which gives access to a card in the Overlord's
    hand
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Vault</b> is a room which controls access to the top card of
    Overlord's deck
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Crypts</b> give access to cards which the Overlord has discarded over
    the course of a game.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other rooms are referred to as <b>outer rooms</b>.</p>

<h1>Schools of Magic</h1>
<p>
  In the world of Spelldawn, certain rare individuals called Riftcallers can
  call upon powerful magical forces in order to accomplish their goals. Each
  card has a school associated with it, and only cards from schools matching
  your Riftcaller can be found during an adventure.
</p>

<p>The schools of magic are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Law:</b> The magic of structure and order.</li>
  <li><b>Beyond:</b> The magic of time and knowledge.</li>
  <li><b>Shadow:</b> The magic of deception and death.</li>
  <li><b>Pact:</b> The magic of blood and bargains.</li>
  <li><b>Primal:</b> The magic of nature and the elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition to these schools, some cards have no school affiliation. These
  are called <b>neutral</b> cards and can be used in any deck.
</p>

<h1>Overlord Cards</h1>

<p>
  There are five types of Overlord cards: rfitcallers, spells, schemes, minions,
  and projects. All cards except the riftcaller card are shuffled into the
  Overlord deck at the start of the game. Cards other than spells are called
  'permanent' cards. Overlord permanent cards are always played face down into
  different rooms.
</p>

<h2>Riftcallers</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      The riftcaller card defines who the Overlord is in the universe of
      Spelldawn. It starts the game in play and provides an ongoing benefit
      throughout the game.
    </p>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    Spell cards represent one-time effects. They're always revealed when played
    and then discarded. The Overlord must pay the listed mana cost of the spell,
    and then the abilities are resolved in order. Once complete, the card is
    moved to the Crypts.

<h2>Schemes</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Scheme cards represent the Overlord's evil machinations to bring about
      their master plan. They are the cards in Spelldawn that are worth points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Overlord plays scheme cards face-down in outer rooms. Each scheme has
      a 'progress requirement' that must be met before the Overlord can score that
      card (see the <a href="#progress-a-card">Progress a Card</a> action).
      There can only ever be one scheme <b>or</b> one project in a room at a
      given time. Schemes often have a
      <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Score</b> ability which resolves when the
      Overlord meets the level requirement.

  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Minions are cards that the Overlord plays in order to defend the rooms of
      the dungeon against the Champion. Minions are played face down in rooms
      <i>without</i> paying their mana cost. They can be
      <b>summoned</b> and turned face up during a raid by paying their mana cost
      if the Overlord has sufficient mana available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each minion typically has a
      <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Combat</b> ability which fires if the
      Champion is unable to defeat this minion during a raid, as well as a
      <b>health</b> and sometimes a <b>shield</b> value. See the
      <a href="#encounter-phase">Encounter Phase</a> section below for more
      information about combat.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Projects provide the Overlord with resources in order to further their
      objectives. They're played in outer rooms in the same manner as schemes,
      <i>without</i> paying their mana cost. Projects can be summoned by the
      Overlord, turning them face up by playing their mana cost. Different
      projects have different rules about when they can be summoned.

<h1>Champion Cards</h1>

<p>
  There are four types of Champion cards: riftcallers, allies, evocations, artifacts, and
  spells. As with the Overlord, the non-riftcaller cards are shuffled together to
  create the Champion's deck. Champion cards are always played face-up.
</p>

<h2>Riftcaller</h2>

<div class="card-image-row left-card">

  </spelldawn-card>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      As with the Overlord, the Champion's rifcaller card defines the character
      the Champion is playing as in the current game. The Champion rifcaller
      card starts the game in play and provides ongoing abilities throughout the game.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Artifacts</h2>
<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Artifacts provide the Champion with ongoing benefits. A subset of
      artifacts called Weapons are used by the Champion to defeat the Overlord's
      minons. The Champion plays weapons by artifacts their mana cost.
      During a raid, a weapon can be used to attack and defeat a minion if it is
      of the correct <a href="#resonance">Resonance</a> and its <b>attack
      value</b> equals or exceeds the minion's health.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each weapon starts with a base attack value which is shown on the card.
      Many weapons also have abilities which can increase their attack value
      during combat by paying mana.
    </p>

    <h4>Icons:</h4>

    <div class="card-icon-row">

<h2>Allies</h2>

<div class="card-image-row left-card">

  </spelldawn-card>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    Allies provide a variety of additional tools for the Champion to draw
    upon. The Champion plays allies by paying their mana cost, and like
    artifacts they enter play face-up and stay in play permanently (or until
    destroyed).
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Evocations</h2>

<div class="card-image-row left-card">
  <spelldawn-card

  </spelldawn-card>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    Evocations are similar to Allies in that they also enter play face-up.
    Evocations tend to provide resources to the Champion while in play, and they
    are more vulnerable to being destroyed because they can be targeted when the
    Champion is cursed (see <a href="#curses">Curses</a> below).
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Spells</h2>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    As with the Overlord, the Champion can wield spell cards to apply one-time
    effects, paying their listed mana cost, resolving the effects in order, and
    then placing them into the discard pile.

<h1>Turn Sequence</h1>

<p>
  Players in Spelldawn alternate taking turns, starting with the Overlord
  player. The Overlord player starts their turn with <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
  <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> (3 action
  points) while the Champion player starts their turn with <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
  <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> <i
  class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> (4 action
  points). A turn consists of these phases:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Start of Turn</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Draw</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Main</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Discard</b> Phase</li>
</ol>

<h2>Start of Turn Phase</h2>
<p>
  During the Start of Turn phase, triggered start-of-turn abilities on cards in
  play fire. The start of the Champion's turn is called <b>Dawn</b> and any
  cards with <i class="fas fa-bolt"></i><b>Dawn</b> trigger their abilities in
  this phase. The start of the Overlord's turn is called <b>Dusk</b> and fires
  <i class="fas fa-bolt"></i><b>Dusk</b> abilities.
</p>

<h2>Draw Phase</h2>

<p>
  The active player draws one card from their deck. If the Overlord player's
  deck is empty, that player immediately loses the game.
</p>

<h2>Main Phase</h2>

<p>
  The player takes actions by spending <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> (action
  points). All action points must be spent during the main phase, after which
  the discard phase immediately begins.
</p>

<p>
  The active player can take the following actions as many times as they like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Gain 1<i
      class="fas fa-fire"
    ></i>
    (one mana)
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Draw a card
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Play a card from hand
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>, 1<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Progress a card (Overlord)
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
    <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> Initiate a raid (Champion)
  </li>
  <li>
    Activate an <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> ability of a card in play
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gain Mana</h3>
<p>
  The player spends <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> to increase their mana pool
  by 1<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
</p>

<h3>Draw a Card</h3>
<p>
  For <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>, the player draws one card from their
  deck. This action cannot be taken if the deck is currently empty.
</p>

<h3>Play a Card</h3>
<p>
  The player pays <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> along with any required costs
  for a card in hand in order to play it.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Spell</b> cards require their mana cost to be paid immediately and
    resolve their effects immediately. They are then moved to the discard pile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Artifact</b>, <b>Ally</b> and <b>Evocation</b> cards require their mana
    cost to be paid immediately and are put into play face up on the Champion's
    side of the game arena.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Scheme</b> cards are played face down in an empty outer room that doesn't
    currently contain a scheme or project. They do not have mana costs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Project</b> cards do <i>not</i> require their mana cost to be paid
    immediately. They are played face down in an outer room that doesn't
    currently contain a scheme or project.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Minion</b> cards do <i>not</i> require their mana cost to be paid
    immediately. They are put into play face down as the outermost defender of a
    room. A maximum of 4 minions can be in a room at any time.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Progress a Room</h3>
<p>
  By paying <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> and 1<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>,
  the Overlord can pick a card to <b>progress</b>. They place one progress
  counter on the card.
</p>

<p>
  When the number of progress counters on a scheme card is greater than or equal to
  its progress requirement, that card will immediately be <b>scored</b>. The scheme
  card is turned face up, and then any <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Score</b>
  abilities trigger. The Overlord gains scheme points equal to the points value
  of the card and it moves to their score area.
</p>

<h3>Initiate a Raid</h3>
<p>
  For <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>, the Champion can initiate a raid against
  one of the Overlord's non-empty rooms in order to score schemes and destroy
  projects. See <a href="#raids">Raids</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>Activate an Abilitiy</h3>
<p>
  Some cards have <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> abilities listed on them.
  These are called <b>activated abilities</b> and can only be used during the
  owning player's Main phase by paying all of the listed costs.
</p>

<h2>Discard Phase</h2>
<p>
  Finally, the active player must discard down to their maximum hand
  size. Players begin the game with a maximum hand size of 5 cards, but card
  effects can increase or decrease this limit.
</p>

<h1>Resonance</h1>
<p>
  The world of Spelldawn is the result of a confluence between three planes of
  existence. The original terrestrial plane is being overlaid by two other
  planes, the astral plane and the abyssal plane, and creatures and items from
  those other worlds are now passing through into the mortal world.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, there are three main types of weapons and minions in Spelldawn, called
  the <b>resonance</b> of that card. They are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="mortal lineage">Mortal</span>: Weapons and creatures from the
    terrestrial plane.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="astral lineage">Astral</span>: Weapons and creatures from
    the Astral Realm, a kingdom of cold starlight.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="abyssal lineage">Abyssal</span>: Weapons and creatures from The
    Abyss, the realm of darkness ruled over by the tyrannical ancient
    Demonlords.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Because of the nature of planar magical interaction, minions can only be damaged
  by a weapon from a matching resonance -- anyone attempt to wield a mortal weapon
  against a creature of Infernum will soon discover that their blade simply
  passes through the enemy like slicing through air!
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the main resonance types, some weapons and minions have special
  properties.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="prismatic lineage">Prismatic</span> weapons are rare and
    powerful magical artifacts which have the ability to damage enemies from any
    resonance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Raids</h1>
<p>
  During a raid, the Champion attacks one of the Overlord's rooms in order to
  foil their schemes and destroy ongoing projects. They encounter each minion
  defending the room in sequence, either defeating that minion using their
  weapons or suffering its combat effects.
</p>
<p>Raids are broken up into three phases:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Start of Raid</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Encounter</b> Phase</li>
  <li><b>Access</b> Phase</li>
</ol>

<h2>Starting a Raid</h2>
<p>
  When a raid is declared on a room, any <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Raid</b>
  abilities on cards in play trigger. Next, the game checks if the room is
  defended by any minions which are face-up or which the Overlord has sufficient
  mana available to summon. If any such minion exists, the raid proceeds to the
  Encounter phase, otherwise it moves to the Access phase.
</p>

<h2>Encounter Phase</h2>

<h3>Approaching Minions</h3>

<p>
  During the encounter phase, the Champion <b>approaches</b> each minion in the
  target room in sequence, starting with the outermost minion. If the defending
  minion is face-down and the Overlord currently has mana available to pay its
  listed summon cost, the minion may be <b>summoned</b>, turning it face up. Any
  <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Summon</b> abilities on the card trigger.
</p>

<p>
  The Champion then <b>encounters</b> the minion if it is face up. Otherwise,
  the Champion approaches the next minion in sequence, or proceeds to the Access
  phase if no minions remain.
</p>

<h3>Encountering a Minion</h3>

<p>
  When a minion is encountered, the Champion must either <b>defeat</b> the
  minion or continue and have its <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Combat</b>
  ability fire.
</p>

<p>In order to defeat a minion, the Champion must do two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Pay an amount of mana equal to the <b>shield</b> value of the minion, if
    any. Some card effects such as the <b>breach</b> keyword reduce the amount
    that must be paid for shield values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Deal damage to the minion equal to its <b>health</b> value. Weapons with the
    same resonance type as the minion deal damage equal to their base attack value
    plus any bonuses from abilities.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Defeat is always temporary for the Overlord's minions, as they are soulbound
  to their post by the summoning ritual and resurrect after a few hours. The
  minion is not removed from the room when defeated, but stays in play -- ready
  for the next raid.
</p>

<p>
  Once the minion is either defeated or has used its combat abilities, the next
  minion in sequence is approached, or the raid moves to the Access phase.
</p>

<h3>Attack Boosts</h3>

<p>
  Many weapons have printed abilities which temporarily increase their attack
  value, called an <b>attack boost</b>, in the form of a cost to add some amount
  of attack. Unless otherwise indicated, this cost can be paid any number of
  times to reach the target, and the increased attack value lasts only for the
  duration of the current minion encounter.
</p>

<p>
  For example, if the Champion has a weapon with a base attack of 3 and a boost
  ability "2<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>: +1 Attack", the champion can pay 2<i
    class="fas fa-fire"
  ></i>
  per attack point required. If they are attempting to defeat a minion with 5
  health, they can do so by paying 4<i class="fas fa-fire"></i> to activate the
  attack boost twice. The weapon's attack value then reverts to 3.
</p>

<h2>Access Phase</h2>

<h3>Raid Success</h3>
<p>
  Once all of the minions defending the target room have been passed, the raid
  is considered a success, and any
  <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Successful Raid</b> triggers on cards in play
  fire. The Champion then <b>accesses</b> cards as follows based on the target
  room:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Sanctum</b>: The Champion accesses one random card from the Overlord's
    hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Vault</b>: The Champion accesses the top card of the Overlord's deck. The
    accessed card is not revealed to the Overlord.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Crypts</b>: The Champion accesses all face-down cards in the Overlord's
    discard pile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Outer Room</b>: The Champion accesses the project or scheme card
    occupying the room.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Cards</h3>
<p>
  When the Champion accesses cards, the actions they can take vary based on the
  type of the accessed card:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the Champion acceses a scheme card they may score it, gaining scheme
    points equal to its points value and then moving it to their score area.
    This does <i>not</i> trigger the
    <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Score</b> ability of the card.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Champion accesses a project card, it becomes revealed. The Champion
    may destroy it by paying its 'raze' cost and then moving it to the
    Overlord's discard pile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other card types have no effect when accessed other than becoming revealed
    to the Champion.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When accessing multiple cards, the Champion may take these actions in any
  order. After concluding access actions, the raid ends and the Champion's main
  phase resumes.
</p>

<h1>Other Card Abilities</h1>

<h2>Damage</h2>

  Some cards and abilities deal <b>damage</b> to the Champion. When the Champion
  takes damage, they must discard one card from their hand at random per point
  of damage dealt. If the Champion takes damage and is unable to discard a card,
  they immediately lose the game.
</p>

<h2>Curses</h2>
<p>
  A card ability may apply a <b>curse</b> to the Champion. Curses can be removed
  by paying <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> and 2<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>.
  While the Champion has a curse card in hand they are said to be <b>cursed</b>.
</p>

  evocation cards during their turn by paying <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
  and 2<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>.

    Champion wins the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Champion takes damage and is unable to discard a card, the Overlord
    wins the game.
  </li>
</ul>
