  <i>Spelldawn</i> is not currently a game you can download and play. At time of
  writing, development is perhaps at most 20% complete, so everything here is
  extremely subject to change based on iteration and playtesting. The game
  doesn't currently have an in-game tutorial of any kind, so this serves as an
  introduction until we can make one.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  <i>Spelldawn</i> is a card game for two players set in a high fantasy
  universe. One player acts as the <b>Overlord</b>, a dungeon master attempting
  to put their nefarious schemes into effect. The other player assumes the role
  of the <b>Champion</b>, a valiant hero attempting to delve into the dungeon
  and thwart the forces of evil.
</p>
<p>
  Players in <i>Spelldawn</i> alternate taking turns, always beginning with the
  Overlord. During a player's turn, they have three
  <b>action points (<i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>)</b> to spend on a variety
  of possible game effects such as gaining
  <b>mana (<i class="fas fa-fire"></i>)</b>, drawing cards, and playing cards.
  The Overlord can play and level up their scheme cards in the rooms of the
  dungeon in order to score points, while deploying minions to defend them. The
  Champion can initiate a <b>raid</b> on a room of the dungeon to attempt to
  bypass the dungeon's defenses and score points by foiling the Overlord's
  plans.
</p>
<p>
  The objective of the game for both players is to score seven points. The
  Overlord scores points by leveling up their scheme cards, while the Champion
  scores points by initiating raids and stopping those schemes. The Champion
  also loses the game if they take too much damage (see
  <a href="#damage">Damage</a> below), and both players lose the game if they
  must draw a card from an empty deck.
</p>

<h2>Schools of Magic</h2>
<p>
  In the world of <i>Spelldawn</i>, certain rare individuals can call upon
  powerful magical forces in order to accomplish their goals. Each person is
  primarily attuned to one of the three great <b>schools</b> of magic, allowing
  them to channel it into their spells for good or evil. Each card has a school
  associated with it and these are important for deckbuilding (see
  <a href="#">Deckbuilding</a> below).
</p>

<p>The schools of magic are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Law:</b> The magic of logic and order.</li>
  <li><b>Primal:</b> The magic of instinct and nature.</li>
  <li><b>Shadow:</b> The magic of deception and darkness.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition to the three schools, some cards have no school affiliation. These
  are called <b>neutral</b> cards and can be used in any deck.
</p>

<h2>Game Overview</h2>

<p>
  To start a game of <i>Spelldawn</i>, each player reveals their
  <b>identity card</b> to their opponent, a special card in play which can grant
  unique abilities throughout a game. Each player starts the game with 5 mana
  and draws 5 cards from their deck to form a starting hand. After drawing
  starting hands, the Overlord may choose to <b>mulligan</b> their hand,
  shuffling it back into their deck and drawing 5 new cards. After the Overlord
  has decided, the Champion decides whether to mulligan as well. The game then
  proceeds to the Overlord's first turn.
</p>

<p>
  The play area in <i>Spelldawn</i> is broken up into eight distinct areas
  called <b>Rooms</b>. These represent the different places within the
  Overlord's dungeon in which they enact their plans.
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/sampleGame.png" />

<p>Three of the rooms are for a special purpose, called <b>inner rooms</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <b>Sanctum</b> is a room which gives access to a card in the Overlord's
    hand
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Vault</b> is a room which controls access to the top card of
    Overlord's deck
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Crypts</b> give access to cards which the Overlord has discarded over
    the course of a game.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other rooms are referred to as <b>outer rooms</b>.</p>

<p>
  The user interface provides access to various features to enable game actions
  to be taken and for the state of different game zones to be inspected. Some of
  the different options are shown here:
</p>

<h2>Overlord Cards</h2>

<p>
  There are five types of Overlord cards: identities, spells, schemes, minions,
  and projects. All cards except the identity card are shuffled into the
  Overlord deck at the start of the game. Overlord permanent cards are played
  face down into different rooms.
</p>

<h3>Identity</h3>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      The identity card defines who the Overlord is in the universe of
      <i>Spelldawn</i>. It influences the
      <a href="#Deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</a> rules for the Overlord player,
      controlling the school to which cards in the deck must belong and how many
      cards are allowed from competing schools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Identity cards start the game in play, and provide abilities which are
      active throughout the game.

  <div class="card-image-text">
    Spell cards represent one-time effects. They're always revealed when played
    and then discarded. The Overlord must pay the listed mana cost of the spell,
    and then the abilities are resolved in order. Once complete, the card is
    moved to the Crypts.

<h3>Schemes</h3>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Scheme cards represent the Overlord's evil machinations to bring about
      their master plan. They are the only cards in <i>Spelldawn</i> that are
      worth scheme points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Overlord plays scheme cards face-down in outer rooms. Each scheme has
      a level requirement that must be met before the Overlord can score that
      card (see <a href="#Leveling_Up">Leveling Up a Card</a>). There can only
      ever be one scheme <b>or</b> one project in a room at a given time.
      Schemes have a <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Score</b> ability which
      resolves when the Overlord meets the level requirement.

  </spelldawn-card>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Minions are cards that the Overlord plays in order to defend the rooms of
      the dungeon against the Champion. Minions are played face down and are
      automatically <b>summoned</b> during a raid by paying their mana cost, if
      the Overlord has sufficient mana available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each minion has a <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Combat</b> ability which
      fires if the Champion is unable to defeat this minion in combat during a
      raid, as well as a <b>health</b> and optionally a <b>shield</b> value. See
      the <a href="#Minions">Minions</a> section below for more information.

      <spelldawn-icon iconType="Shield" value="2"></spelldawn-icon>
      <b>Shield value</b>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Projects provide the Overlord with resources in order to further their
      objectives. They're played in outer rooms in the same manner as schemes.
      projects specify their <b>Unveil</b> trigger which causes them to be
      turned face up <i>if</i> the Overlord has sufficient mana available to pay
      their listed mana cost.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some projects with the <b>Level Up</b> keyword can be leveled up in the
      same manner as schemes, in order to mislead the Champion. When the
      Champion accesses a project they can <b>destroy</b> it by paying mana
      equal to its mana cost.
    </p>

<h2>Champion Cards</h2>

<p>
  There are four types of Champion cards: identities, weapons, artifacts, and
  spells. As with the Overlord, the non-identity cards are shuffled together to
  create the Champion's deck. Champion cards are always played face-up.
</p>

<h3>Identity</h3>

<div class="card-image-row left-card">
  <spelldawn-card

    championCompetingSchools="8"
  >
    <p><b>{#}Dawn:</b> If you have no cards in hand, draw a card.</p>
  </spelldawn-card>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      As with the Overlord, the Champion's identity card defines the character
      the Champion is playing as in the current game. The same
      <a href="#Deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</a> restrictions apply to the
      Champion deck. The Champion identity card starts the game in play and
      provides ongoing abilities throughout the game.
    </p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Weapons</h3>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>
      Weapons are used by the Champion to defeat the Overlord's minons. The
      Champion plays weapons by paying their mana cost. During a raid, a weapon
      can be used to attack and defeat a minion if it is of the correct
      <a href="#Faction">Faction</a> and its <b>attack value</b> equals or
      exceeds the minion's health.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each weapon starts with a base attack value which is shown on the card.
      Many weapons also have abilities which can increase their attack value
      during combat by paying mana.
    </p>

    <h4>Icons:</h4>

    <div class="card-icon-row">

<h3>Artifacts</h3>

  <div class="card-image-text">
    Artifacts provide a variety of additional tools for the Champion to draw
    upon. The Champion plays artifacts by paying their mana cost, and like
    weapons they enter play face-up and stay in play permanently (or until
    destroyed).
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Spells</h3>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    As with the Overlord, the Champoin can wield Spell cards to apply one-time
    effects, paying their listed mana cost, resolving the effects in order, and
    then placing them into the discard pile.
