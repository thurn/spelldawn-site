**Spelldawn** is a digital card game based on Richard Garfield's classic 1996 game *Netrunner* and its 2012 Fantasy Flight Games remake *Android: Netrunner*. If Netrunner were Magic: The Gathering, Spelldawn would be Hearthstone -- a version of the game thatâ€™s simplified for fast play on mobile devices but which preserves the core gameplay elements.

Spelldawn is open source under the Apache License, although the client uses proprietary art assets under the terms of the Unity Asset Store license. The game is 100% free to play, but unlike *Android: Netrunner* it is a trading card game. As you play, you will collect cards which you can trade with other players, putting an emphasis on your ability to build decks with the cards you have instead of following an existing metagame. Periodic "seasons" will encourage you to start this process over with an empty collection.
