<p>
  Spelldawn is implemented using a 'thin client' model, with a small Unity
  application implemented in C# providing a user interface and a game server
  written Rust providing the game logic itself. This page describes how to set
  up a development environment to contribute to the project.
</p>

<h1>Server Development Environment</h1>
<p>
  Throughout this section, these icons give OS-specific information about the
  setup process:
</p>

<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> Set up information for Windows
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> Set up information for Mac OS
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-linux"></i> Set up information for Linux
</div>

<h2>1) Install Command Line Tools</h2>
<p>
  The build system for Spelldawn assumes basic UNIX command line tools will exist,
  such as <code>sh</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>mkdir</code>,
  <code>cp</code>, and <code>grep</code>.
</p>

<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> A simple option to set up a command line
  environment on Windows is the <a href="https://cmder.app/">Cmder</a> console
  emulator, which bundles standard UNIX tools with a nice terminal. A more
  comprehensive alternative is to install
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install"
    >Windows Subsystem for Linux</a
  >, which includes a complete Linux distribution. If you use this option,
  follow the <i class="fab fa-linux"></i> options below instead.
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-linux"></i><i class="fab fa-apple"></i> These tools should
  already be installed on your system.
</div>

<h2>2) Install Git</h2>
<p>
  Spelldawn uses the Git version control system to manage code, so you will need
  a copy of it. The
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"
    >Installing Git</a
  >
  section of the Git website gives information about how to do this.
</p>

<p>
  Note: You can use Github Desktop if you'd like, but you will get an
  authentication error after cloning the repository and need to manually add it
  again from your filesystem. This is because Github Desktop always fetches
  submodules, there is no way to disable this behavior.
</p>

<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> The
  <a href="https://cmder.app/">Cmder</a> environment mentioned above includes
  Git for Windows. Otherwise, you can download it from the link above.
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> The git command is bundled with Mac OS, although
  you can consider installing a newer version via
  <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-linux"></i> Linux package managers include Git, e.g.
  <code>sudo apt install git</code>
</div>

<h2>3) Install Rust and Cargo</h2>
<p>
  Spelldawn is written in the Rust programming language and uses the standard
  <code>cargo</code> package manager. The
  <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install"
    >https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</a
  >
  website gives information about how to set it up using <code>rustup</code>.
</p>

<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> For windows, you will also need a copy of the
  MSVC compiler. The Rust installer should prompt you to install Visual Studio
  Community Edition.
</div>

<h2>4) Install CMake</h2>
<p>
  We use the <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC RPC Framework</a> to communicate
  between the server and the client. gRPC depends on the
  <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> build tool being on your system
  <code>$PATH</code>
  for compilation.
</p>

<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-windows"></i>
  <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">https://cmake.org/download/</a> provides
  a Windows MSI installer. You should be prompted to add CMake to your PATH
  system variable, which is required for the code to compile.
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> You can install CMake via the
  <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> package manager:
  <code>brew install cmake</code>
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-linux"></i> Linux package managers should contain CMake, e.g.
  via <code>sudo apt install cmake</code>.
</div>

<h2>5) Install Just</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> is a command runner. It's a
  useful way of bundling together scripts for a project. If you followed step #1
  correctly, running <code>cargo install just</code> should set it up for you.
</p>

<h2>6) Clone the project files</h2>
<p>
  Navigate to
  <a href="https://github.com/thurn/spelldawn/fork"
    >https://github.com/thurn/spelldawn/fork</a
  >
  to create a fork of the project for your changes. You will need to create a
  GitHub account if you don't already have one. Then run
</p>

<p>
  <code> git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/spelldawn.git </code>
</p>

<p>
  to download a local copy of the project, replacing
  <code>{your_username}</code> with your Github account name.
</p>

<h2>7) Build the Server</h2>
<p>
  If you followed all of the previous steps correctly, you should be able to
  <code>cd spelldawn</code> to change to the spelldawn directory and then
  compile and run the game server via:
</p>

<p>
  <code>just run</code>
</p>

<p>If everything is working correctly, you should get the message</p>

<p>
  <code>Server listening on 0.0.0.0:50052</code>
</p>

<h1>Client Development Environment</h1>

<h2>1) Install Unity & Unity Hub</h2>
<p>
  Once you've completed setting up the server development environment, you can
  set up the client and connect it to your running server. To start you will
  need to install Unity. The best way to do this is to install
  <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">Unity Hub</a>, which manages
  Unity installations.
</p>

<p>
  Once Unity Hub is installed, you must install the version of the Unity Editor
  currently listed in the project's <a
  href="https://github.com/thurn/spelldawn/blob/master/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt">ProjectVersion.txt</a>
  file. You may need to visit the <a
  href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive">Unity Download
  Archive</a> to find a copy of the correct version.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have installed the correct verison of Unity, use the "Add Project"
  button in Unity Hub to select the spelldawn directory, and then click on the
  project name to open it. The initial project import process will take some
  time to complete.
</p>

<h2>2) Open the Game Scene</h2>
<p>
  Once the project is open, expand the "Scenes" directory and click on the scene
  called "Game". This is the primary Unity scene used for gameplay.
</p>

<h2>3) Camera Alignment</h2>
<p>
  Select the "Main Camera" in the scene hiearchy, and then select "Align View to
  Selected" in the Unity GameObject menu. This step enables you to see what is
  going on in the scene view while the game is running.
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/alignViewToSelected.png" width="200" />

<h2>4) Configure Simulator</h2>
<p>
  Navigate to the "Game" view and click the dropdown in the tab name. Switch it
  to "Simulator". Select an iPhone SE (2nd Edition) simulator and rotate it to
  landscape. This lets you view the game as it will appear on-device.
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/simulator.png" />

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> You will only see the development 'graybox' assets in the
  simulator. This is expected. The production art assets are separately licensed
  under the terms of the Unity Asset Store License and are not included in the
  github repository.
</p>

<h2>5) Run the Game</h2>
<p>
  If you click the Play button, the game should begin. In the Unity console, you
  should see the message
</p>

<p>
  <code>Connecting to http://localhost:50052</code>
</p>

<p>
  In the terminal where you invoked <code>just run</code>, you should see the message
</p>

<p>
  <code>WARN server::requests: received_connection</code>
</p>

<h2>6) Start a new game</h2>

<p>
  Click the debug button on the top-right of the screen. After a small delay,
  you should see the debug controls menu appear
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/debugControls.png" />

<p>
  You can click "New Game" here to start a new game. There are also several
  other useful commands, for example you can use "Flip View" to change the
  player whose perspective you are viewing. You can also assign an AI Agent to
  be your opponent in the new game, change action and mana values, and use the
  'save state' and 'load state' buttons to snapshot the current game state to
  return to it later.
</p>

<p>
  After clicking "New Game", you should see an opening hand. The game has started!
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/runningGame.png" />

<p>
  No AI Agent is assigned for your opponent by default, so nothing will happen
  initially. You can assign one yourself or switch back and forth between
  players using the "Flip View" command to manually play out a game.
</p>

<h1>Optional Setup</h1>
<p>
  There are a few more optional setup steps for an improved overall development
  experience.
</p>
<h2>Install Rust Nightly</h2>
<p>
  Nightly rust is not used for compiling the project itself, but it provides
  useful tooling features such as expanded <code>rustfmt</code> capabilities.
  Install it via <code>rustup</code>
</p>

<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-windows"></i> <code>rustup toolchain add nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc</code>
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> <code>rustup toolchain add
  nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin</code> (or <code>nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin</code>)
</div>
<div class="os-row">
  <i class="fab fa-linux"></i> <code>rustup target add nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>
</div>

<h2>Install Criterion</h2>
<p>
  Criterion is a fantastic benchmarking tool which powers our benchmark tests.
  In order to run the tests, you should run <code>cargo install cargo-criterion</code>
</p>

<h2>Install a custom linker</h2>
<p>
  Using a custom linker can significantly improve compilation speed. The <code>lld</code>
  linker on Mac OS and Windows and the <code>mold</code> linker on Linux are good options
  that can be installed from standard package managers.
</p>

<p>
  Create a <code>~/.cargo/config.toml</code> file on your system
  and then add a custom linker configuration for your build target:
</p>

<p>
  <pre>
    [target.aarch64-apple-darwin]
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/ld64.lld"]

    [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
    linker = "clang"
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/path/to/mold"]
  </pre>
</p>
