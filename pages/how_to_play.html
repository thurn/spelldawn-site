  <i>Spelldawn</i> is not currently a game you can download and play. At time of
  writing, development is perhaps at most 20% complete, so everything here is
  extremely subject to change based on iteration and playtesting. The game
  doesn't currently have an in-game tutorial of any kind, so this serves as an
  introduction until we can make one.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  <i>Spelldawn</i> is a card game for two players set in a high fantasy
  universe. One player acts as the <b>Overlord</b>, a dungeon master attempting
  to put their nefarious schemes into effect. The other player assumes the role
  of the <b>Champion</b>, a valiant hero attempting to delve into the dungeon
  and thwart the forces of evil.
</p>
<p>
  Players in <i>Spelldawn</i> alternate taking turns, always beginning with the
  Overlord. During a player's turn, they have three <b>action points</b> to
  spend on a variety of possible game effects such as gaining mana, drawing
  cards, and playing cards. The Overlord can play and level up their scheme
  cards in the rooms of the dungeon in order to score points, while deploying
  minions to defend them. The Champion can initiate a <b>raid</b> on a room of
  the dungeon to attempt to bypass the dungeon's defenses and score points by
  foiling the Overlord's plans.
</p>
<p>
  The objective of the game for both players is to score seven points. The
  Overlord scores points by leveling up their scheme cards, while the Champion
  scores points by initiating raids and stopping those schemes. The Champion
  also loses the game if they take too much damage (see
  <a href="#damage">Damage</a>
  below), and both players lose the game if they must draw a card from an empty
  deck.
</p>

<h2>Schools of Magic</h2>
<p>
  In the world of <i>Spelldawn</i>, certain rare individuals can call upon
  powerful magical forces in order to accomplish their goals. Each person is
  primarily attuned to one of the three great <b>schools</b> of magic, allowing
  them to channel it into their spells for good or evil. Each card has a school
  associated with it and these are important for deckbuilding (see
  <a href="#">Deckbuilding</a> below).
</p>

<p>The schools of magic are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Law:</b> The magic of logic and order.</li>
  <li><b>Primal:</b> The magic of instinct and nature.</li>
  <li><b>Shadow:</b> The magic of deception and darkness.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition to the three schools, some cards have no school affiliation. These
  are called <b>neutral</b> cards and can be used in any deck.
</p>

<h2>Game Overview</h2>

<p>
  To start a game of <i>Spelldawn</i>, each player reveals their
  <b>Identity Card</b> to their opponent, a special card in play which can grant
  unique abilities throughout a game. Each player starts the game with 5 mana
  and draws 5 cards from their deck to form a starting hand. After drawing
  starting hands, the Overlord may choose to <b>mulligan</b> their hand,
  shuffling it back into their deck and drawing 5 new cards. After the Overlord
  has decided, the Champion decides whether to mulligan as well. The game then
  proceeds to the Overlord's first turn.
</p>

<p>
  The play area in <i>Spelldawn</i> is broken up into eight distinct areas
  called <b>Rooms</b>. These represent the different places within the
  Overlord's dungeon in which they enact their plans.
</p>

<p>Three of the rooms are for a special purpose, called <b>Inner Rooms</b>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <b>Sanctum</b> is a room which gives access to a card in the Overlord's
    hand
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Vault</b> is a room which controls access to the top card of
    Overlord's deck
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Crypts</b> give access to cards which the Overlord has discarded over
    the course of a game.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The user interface provides access to various features to enable game actions
  to be taken and for the state of different game zones to be inspected. Some of
  the different options are shown here:

<h2>Overlord Cards</h2>

<p>
  There are five types of Overlord cards: identities, spells, schemes, minions,
  and projects. All cards except the identity card are shuffled into the
  Overlord deck at the start of the game. Overlord permanent cards are played
  face down into different Rooms.
</p>

<h3>Identity</h3>

<div class="card-image-row right-card">
  <div class="card-image-text">
    <p>The identity card defines who the Overlord is in the universe of
    <i>Spelldawn</i>. It influences the
    <a href="#Deckbuilding">Deckbuilding</a> rules for the Overlord player,
    controlling the School to which cards in the deck must belong and how many
    cards are allowed from competing Schools.</p>

    <p>Identity cards start the game in play, and provide abilities which are active throughout the game.</p>

    Spell cards represent one-time effects. They're always revealed when played
    and then discarded. The Overlord must pay the listed mana cost of the spell,
    and then the abilities are resolved in order. Once complete, the card is
    moved to the Crypts.
