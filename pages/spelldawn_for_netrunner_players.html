title: Spelldawn for Netrunner Players
layout: page
---

{% include toc.html %}

<p>
  Spelldawn is based on the game <i>Android: Netrunner</i>. This page provides
  an overview of the differences for players who already familiar with that
  game. For a more comprehensive rules overview, see
  <a href="/pages/how_to_play.html">How to Play</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The most significant difference between Spelldawn and <i>Netrunner</i> is that
  turns in Spelldawn happen completely independently. Players cannot take
  actions or make decisions of any kind during their opponent's turn. This
  necessitates substantially different gameplay. For example, the equivalents to
  ICE are <b>automatically</b> rezzed when approached.
</p>

<h1>Terminology Mapping</h1>
<p>
  This table shows the mapping between concepts from <i>Netrunner</i> and
  concepts in Spelldawn. This is an approximate guide for reference purposes,
  not all of these terms work in exactly the same way in both games.

<h1>Rules Differences</h1>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>
  As discussed above, players in Spelldawn cannot act during their opponent's
  turn. Cards that can be activated outside of a player's main phase do not
  exist. Instead of being able to rez cards at any time, Overlord cards provide
  specific rules for when they are revealed. For example, a project card with
  "<b>Unveil</b> at Dusk" will be turned face-up if the Overlord has sufficient
  mana to pay its unveil cost at the start of their turn.
</p>

<p>
  Both players in Spelldawn receive <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i>
  <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> <i class="fas fa-hourglass"></i> for their
  turn. The Champion player automatically draws a card at the start of their
  turn in the same manner as the Overlord, and also loses the game if their deck
  runs out.
</p>

<p>
  The 'level up' game action in Spelldawn is similar to the 'advance a card'
  game action in <i>Netrunner</i>, except that it distributes a level counter to
  <b>each</b>
  card in the target room which can be leveled up. Scoring in Spelldawn is
  always immediate, schemes can never have more level counters on them than
  their level requirement.
</p>

<h2>Playing Cards</h2>
<p>
  The Overlord player in Spelldawn starts the game with 3 inner rooms (the
  Vault, the Sanctum, and the Crypts) and 5 outer rooms, and cannot create more
  during a game. If all 5 rooms are occupied, additional schemes and projects
  cannot be played.
</p>

<p>
  'Upgrade' cards do not exist in Spelldawn. Each room can only ever have one
  occupant.
</p>

<p>
  Minions defending a room are limited to a maximum of 4. Playing an additional
  minion into a room beyond this limit causes the innermost minion to be
  discarded. There is no additional increasing cost in Spelldawn to play minions
  beyond the first minion in each room.
</p>

<p>
  'Memory Units' do not exist in Spelldawn. The Champion can play up to 5
  weapons, after which playing a weapon causes the oldest weapon to be
  discarded. The Champion can play a maximum of 8 artifacts, after which playing
  an artifact causes the oldest artifact to be discarded.
</p>

<h2>Hand Size</h2>
<p>
  Both players in Spelldawn have a maximum hand size of 7 cards. If they have
  more than 7 cards in hand at the end of their turn, they discard their oldest
  (leftmost) cards until they are below their maximum hand size.
</p>

<h2>Minions</h2>
<p>
  Minion cards are automatically summoned during a raid if the Overlord has
  sufficient mana available to pay their summon cost. There are no 'subroutines'
  which can be individually broken, instead each minion has a
  <b><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>Combat</b> ability which fires if they are not
  defeated during a raid.
</p>

<p>
  Instead of having a 'strength', minions have a health value. In order to
  defeat a minion, the Champion must sufficiently raise the attack of one of
  their weapons to deal damage equal to the health value. Some minions also have
  a shield value, which is an amount of mana which must be paid in order to
  target them with a weapon.
</p>

<p>
  There are three types of minions and weapons called Infernal, Abyssal, and
  Mortal. These function in a similar manner to the Sentry/Barrier/Code Gate
  system from <i>Netrunner</i> -- only a matching weapon can be used to defeat a
  minion.
</p>

<h2>Raids</h2>
<p>
  During a raid, there is no option for the Champion to 'jack out' between
  encounters. Each minion must be encountered sequentially unless a card effect
  ends the raid.
</p>

<p>
  Cards do not have a separate 'trash cost' in Spelldawn. Instead, the Champion
  may destroy a project card by paying mana equal to its unveil cost.
</p>

<h2>Deckbuilding</h2>
<p>
  Decks in Spelldawn are always 50 cards for both players, and can contain no
  more than 3 copies of a card. The Overlord deck must contain at least 20
  scheme points.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of an 'influence' system for cards, identity cards simply specify the
  <i>number</i> of cards from other factions (called 'schools' in Spelldawn)
  that are allowed to be in a deck.
</p>

<h2>Other Concepts</h2>

<p>
  Traces, link strength, bad publicity, and virus counters do not exist in
  Spelldawn. There is no direct equivalent to tags, but they have some
  mechanical overlap with
